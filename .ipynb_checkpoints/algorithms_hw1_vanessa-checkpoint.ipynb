    "\n",
    "Truth is, no algorithm is neutral. It is necessarily defined by someone. In this case, the algorithm seems to be a complex construction based on a user’s virtual rename. So, for example, the reviews written by well-known users appears as Yelp´s preferred reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "An established is someone who has already written at least a few reviews. My guess is that the the length of your inscription on Yelp is another decisive factor.  Others questions that Yelp´s algorithm might be asking when determining whose reviews deserved to be recommended might be: how many times per day is the user active? Has the user been rather active or passive? Is the user only reading the reviews or is she/he also providing content? The algorithm might also prefer users who have a complete profile on Yelp and don´t mind sharing information such as their age, gender, address as well as links to their various social media accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I imagine that the user´s location could also be a key feature. Could it even be possible for an algorithm to use cellphone´s GPS data to tell whether or not the user has actually visited the place recommended? Hence, in that way measurements could be quantified."
